# we should stash the delivery id in a contextvar and include it in logging
# also maybe structlog? eh print is so handy for now

# Maybe:
# send message on first PR, with basic background info ‚Äì volunteer project,
# super appreciate their contribution, also means we're sometimes slow.
# how to ping?
#
# send message with invitation giving info
#
# after they accept, post a closed issue to welcome them, and invite them to
# ask any questions and introduce themselves there? and also highlight it in
# the chat? (include link to search for their contributions, as part of the
# introduction?)
#
# in the future would be nice if bot could do some pings, both ways
#
# include some specific suggestions on how to get help? assign a mentor from a
# list of volunteers?
#
# I almost wonder if it would be better to give membership on like, the 3rd
# merged PR
# with the bot keeping track, and posting an encouraging countdown on each
# merged PR, so it feels more like an incremental process, where you can see
# the milestone coming and then when you get there it *is* a milestone.
